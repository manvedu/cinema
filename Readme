Database must first be created before you attempt to connect to connect Sequel to the database.
bundle exec irb
Bundler.require
is not necessary because we are going to use sqlite3, it creates db if it does not exists
if you can access to db directly --> as rails c --> sequel sqlite://test.db


For run migrations 

sequel -m db/migrations/ sqlite://test.db 
DB.table_exists?(:movies) verify if a tbale exits
